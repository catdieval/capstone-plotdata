# PlotData - Web application for creating data visualizations
With PlotData you can easily make customizable publication-quality charts, all without programming skills. You can upload a csv file and walk through the different steps to generate a chart, with the help of the [JavaScript Plotly library](https://plotly.com/javascript/basic-charts/). Also you can update the chart with new values and export it as png file for use in reports or presentations.
